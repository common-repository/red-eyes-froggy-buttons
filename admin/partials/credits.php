<h2>Credits</h2>
<div style="width:50%">
<p>All CSS code I used in this plugin is freely available on the Internet. In many cases I've got to modify it to make it dynamic. I often has to write down some javascript to dynamically setsome attribure or some css variable. Sometimes I wrote some effect from scracth or almost from scratch. I am aware that in these rare cases the effect obtained is very simple even if it seemed nice enough to insert it into the plugin.</p>
<p>Here you can find the links to the original css code used in this plugin.</p>
<p>All this to clarify that I am not the author of CSS: the purpose of this plugin is not to propose original css code. My goal is to make that code easily usable and customizable to WordPress users.</p>
<p></p>I hope to have succeeded in my intent and I hope that you will enjoy.</p>
<p>The Premium version of the plugin provides a considerably larger number of effects and overall a more granular control over the customization process.</p>
<p>With future updates, I plan to provide more effects and further customization options.</p>
<p class="warning">Notice that some effect looks better on a dark background, others looks better with a faster animation and so on: use controls provided to adjust the properties' values to achive the best result.</p>
